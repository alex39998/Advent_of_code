Contains hardware solutions for advent of code 2025.

Day1 is prototyped in python and the final solution is written in hardcaml. I opted to slightly pre-process the text file inputs 
in the testbench (from L10 to -10). Implementing that in hardware would be relatvely trivial and thus I decided to just handle it simulataion side in software.
